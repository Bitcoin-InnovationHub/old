Contribute projects to the Bitcoin InnovationHub

Projects will be implemented in this website by adding them to this GitHub Repository.



## Contribute a project

You have to create your own GitHub repository for each individual project. Otherwise you can fork this repository, present your idea and create a Pull Request afterwards.


1. On GitHub, navigate to this site's repository.
2. Navigate to the _posts directory.
3. Create a new file called YYYY-MM-DD-NAME-OF-POST.md, replacing YYYY-MM-DD with the date of your post and NAME-OF-POST with the name of your post.
4. Add the following YAML frontmatter to the top of the file, replacing POST TITLE with the post's title, YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss -0000 with the date and time for the      post, and CATEGORY-1 and CATEGORY-2 with as many categories you want for your post.

```layout: post
title: "POST TITLE"
date: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss -0000
categories: CATEGORY-1 CATEGORY-2```

5. Below the frontmatter, add content for your post.

6. At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file. You can attribute the commit to more than one     author in the commit message.

7. Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is the default branch, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request. For more information, see "[Creating a new pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request)".
 
8. Click Propose file change

9. Create a pull request for your proposed changes.

10. In the "Pull Requests" list, click the pull request you would like to merge.
  
11. Click Merge pull request. For more information, see "[Merging a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/merging-a-pull-request)".

12. If prompted, type a commit message, or accept the default message.

13. Click Confirm merge.
14. Optionally, delete the branch. For more information, see "[Creating and deleting branches within your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)".
